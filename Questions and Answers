Q: Why don't the little graphics show up right in the text messages?
A: You mean the emojis? Text messages don't actually send the emoji. They send a number code and every emoji is supposed to have its own number code. But not every cell phone uses the same codes for the same emoji so sometimes the codes don't match up and your phone doesn't show you the same little picture the other person meant to send. There's a international standard phones are supposed to adhere to about it but usually don't for whatever marketing/profit motive.

Q: Why do I need a Google address to use my phone? I have *insert carrier name*, not Google.
A: Your *carrier name* account lets you make phone calls and get on the internet. You need a Google account for apps and to back up all your pictures and stuff so that when you switch phones or get fed up with *carrier name* and switch to some other company you can keep all your stuff onto your new phone. It's a bit more complicated but that's the simple answer.
